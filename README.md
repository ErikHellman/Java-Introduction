# Java Introduction for Android course

This repo contains a base project that can be opened in Android Studio.

The purpose is to be used for learning the basic Java programming language.
You can safely ignore the `mylibrary` module here. It is only needed in order for
Android Studio to detect the Java module.

All code should be added and edited in the `javaintro` module.
